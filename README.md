# Health Hub

**Health Hub** will help you with your health and fitness goals - let you plan your days by adding classes or exercises that focus on strength, cardio, core, or recovery training!  You'll also be able to add goals to march towards to help you stay focused on your "better you" journey!

It is a MERN Stack client application, built with React and Node.js and interacts with the [Health API](https://github.com/BeccaK8/health-api) (built with MongoDB/Mongoose and Express.js)
